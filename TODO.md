# Todo

    Camera controls
    => fov (1e personne)
    => auto zoom
    => object focus

    other integrators (presque fait, implementer le tableau)

    smart timestep

    Load and display textures => later

    Make textblock based ui => yeah dont really care => no actually that would be kinda pratical
        (fontsize is equal to line size? if so we can easily place things vertically)

    Mesh manager
        store a unit scale for the models so you can all have them be 1m in characteristic length
